# Homebridge Enphase Envoy

Homebridge plugin that publishes **solar production** and **home consumption** from an Enphase Envoy / IQ Gateway as **Matter electrical sensors**, so they appear in the Apple Home **Energy** view on iOS 27 and later.

</span>

## What this plugin does

It exposes exactly two things per gateway:

| Sensor | Matter device type | Reports |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| Solar Production | ElectricalSensor (0x0510) | live watts, lifetime energy **exported** |
| Home Consumption | ElectricalSensor (0x0510) | live watts, lifetime energy **imported** |

Import and export are relative to the endpoint: the PV array *delivers* energy, the house *draws* it. That distinction is what lets a controller tell a producer from a load.

### Why Matter and not HomeKit

Apple Home's Energy view is driven by Matter's `ElectricalPowerMeasurement` and `ElectricalEnergyMeasurement` clusters. Classic HomeKit (HAP) has no power or energy characteristic, so no arrangement of HAP services can populate that view — custom "Eve" characteristics only ever show up in Eve-class apps. This plugin therefore registers **no HomeKit accessories at all**; it publishes over Matter only.

## Requirements

- **Homebridge 2.4.0 or later** — earlier builds have no `ElectricalSensor` Matter device type
- **Matter enabled on this plugin's child bridge** — Homebridge UI → plugin settings → Bridge Settings → enable Matter
- Node.js 20 or later
- An Envoy / IQ Gateway on your local network, firmware v5 through v8

Consumption requires consumption CTs installed on the gateway. Without them the plugin publishes the production sensor only and says so in the log.

## Installation

Install through the Homebridge UI, or:

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-enphase-envoy
```

Then enable Matter on the plugin's child bridge and restart Homebridge. Pair the Matter bridge with the Home app if you have not already.

## Configuration

Configure through the Homebridge UI, or add a platform block by hand:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "enphaseEnvoy",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Envoy",
          "host": "192.168.1.35",
          "envoyFirmware7xxTokenGenerationMode": 1,
          "enlightenUser": "user@example.com",
          "enlightenPasswd": "password",
          "refreshInterval": 30
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `name` | — | **Required.** Name for the gateway; prefixes the sensor names. |
| `host` | `envoy.local` | Hostname or IP address of the gateway. |
| `envoyFirmware7xxTokenGenerationMode` | `0` | `0` no token (firmware v5/v6), `1` generate a token from Enlighten credentials, `2` use a token you supply. |
| `enlightenUser` / `enlightenPasswd` | — | Enlighten account, required for mode `1`. |
| `envoyToken` | — | A JWT from [entrez.enphaseenergy.com](https://entrez.enphaseenergy.com), required for mode `2`. |
| `envoyPasswd` | last 6 of serial | Only for firmware v5/v6, if the gateway password is non-default. |
| `productionEnabled` | `true` | Publish the solar production sensor. |
| `productionName` | `<name> Solar Production` | Name of the production sensor. |
| `consumptionEnabled` | `true` | Publish the home consumption sensor. |
| `consumptionName` | `<name> Home Consumption` | Name of the consumption sensor. |
| `refreshInterval` | `30` | Seconds between gateway reads. Minimum 5. |
| `log.*` | — | `success`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug` toggles. |

Multiple gateways are supported — add more entries to `devices`.

### Authentication

- **Firmware v5/v6** — no token. Most gateways serve the data endpoints unauthenticated; if yours challenges, the plugin answers with HTTP Digest using the `envoy` account and the last six digits of the serial number (override with `envoyPasswd`).
- **Firmware v7 and later** — a JWT is required. Mode `1` mints one from your Enlighten credentials and caches it under Homebridge's storage path, renewing it an hour before expiry. Mode `2` uses a token you generated yourself.

The plugin detects which is needed from `/info.xml`, and falls back to the other URL scheme if the configured one is unreachable.

## How readings are sourced

The plugin reads `/production.json?details=1`, which returns production and consumption in a single call:

- **Production** comes from the production CT (`eim`) when one is installed and reporting, otherwise from the microinverters' own reports (`inverters`).
- **Consumption** comes from the `total-consumption` CT. On a gateway wired for net metering only, house load is reconstructed as `production + net-consumption`.
- If `/production.json` is unavailable the plugin falls back to `/api/v1/production`, which reports production only.

Lifetime energy counters are held at their high-water mark, since Matter treats cumulative energy as monotonic and a momentary dip in a gateway reading would otherwise surface as a bogus spike in the Home app.

Live power is pushed on every poll. Cumulative energy is pushed at most once a minute — Matter delivers energy updates as events to every subscribed controller without throttling, so a faster cadence is just noise.

## Upgrading from v10

v11 is a deliberate reduction in scope. The plugin previously exposed inverters, batteries, Ensemble/Enpower/Encharge devices, meters, grid profiles, production switches, and MQTT/REST integrations as HomeKit accessories. All of that is gone; only the two Matter energy sensors remain.

On first run v11 removes the HomeKit accessories cached by earlier versions. Configuration keys for the gateway address and authentication are unchanged, so those parts of an existing config keep working — everything else is ignored.

If you need the full accessory tree, stay on [v10.7.7](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-enphase-envoy/v/10.7.7).

## Troubleshooting

**"Matter export disabled: api.matter is unavailable"** — Matter is not enabled on this plugin's child bridge, or Homebridge is older than 2.4.0. Enable Matter in the plugin's Bridge Settings and restart.

**Sensors appear but show no energy history** — the Energy view builds history over time from the cumulative counters; it will not backfill.

**"Gateway reports no consumption data"** — your gateway has no consumption CTs installed. Only the production sensor can be published.
